# THEORY-OF-ALGORITHMS 2023

## About this repository
This is the repository containing my project work done, during Theory of Algorithms module BSc (Hons) in Software Development at Atlantic Technological University (ATU), using jupyter notebook.

This project concerns work on polynomial time which is a measure of the complexity of an algorithm, where the running time increases as a polynomial function of the size of the input.

## Interaction with this repository
- Interaction can be done locally, by cloning this repository to a folder on your local PC, then using the command git clone (REPOSITORY HTTPS HERE) in the command line.

- Alternatively interaction can be done locally, by creating/using a ssh key link below, then cloning the repository locally using the same method as above, git clone (SSH HERE) in the command line.

- Using Jupyter Notebook, can be done in two ways, by installing jupyter notebook using anaconda link below, or installing jupyter notebook through visual studio code which can be done by clicking extensions in the side bar and search for Jupyter Notebook.

- My Jupyter Notebook can be viewed, but not interacted on this repository by clicking the Polynomial Time.ipynb file from above.

- Python is also needed for interaction, and can be downloaded from the internet in many ways, normally simply searching python, or through visual studio code when you click extensions in the side bar and search for python.
