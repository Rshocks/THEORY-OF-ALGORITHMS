# THEORY-OF-ALGORITHMS 2023
![image info](./pictures/atu.jpg)

This is the repository containing my project work done, during Theory of Algorithms module BSc (Hons) in Software Development at Atlantic Technological University (ATU), using jupyter notebook.

This project concerns work on polynomial time which is a measure of the complexity of an algorithm, where the running time increases at most as a polynomial function of the size of the input.

## Interacting/About this repository
- Interaction can be done locally, by cloning this repository to a folder on your local PC, using the command, git clone HTTPS HERE.

- Alternatively interaction can be done locally, by creating/using a ssh key link below, then cloning the repository locally using the same method as above, git clone SSH HERE.

- Using Jupyter Notebook, can be done in two ways, by installing jupyter notebook using anaconda link below, or installing jupyter notebook through visual studio code when you click extensions in the side bar and search for Jupyter Notebook.

- My Jupyter Notebook can be seen also through GitHub by clicking the Polynomial Time.ipynb file from above.

- Python is also needed for interaction, and can be downloaded off the internet in many ways, or through visual studio code when you click extensions in the side bar and search for python.
